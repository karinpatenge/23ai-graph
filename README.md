# 23c-graph

## Tests with Oracle Database 23 and its SQL/PGQ support

Effective with Oracle Database 23c, you can create and query SQL property graphs.
Check the [documentation](https://docs.oracle.com/en/database/oracle/property-graph/23.3/spgdg/sql-property-graphs.html) for more information.

## Prerequisites

Make sure to have an Oracle Database 23c installed, provisioned, or running in a container. The free developer release is a full-featured Oracle Database and packaged for ease of use and simple [download](https://www.oracle.com/uk/database/free/get-started/).

I recommend you also install [SQLcl](https://www.oracle.com/database/sqldeveloper/technologies/sqlcl/download/). Oracle SQLcl (SQL Developer Command Line) is a Java-based command line interface for Oracle Database. Using SQLcl, you can execute SQL and PL/SQL statements in interactive or batch mode. SQLcl provides inline editing, statement completion, command recall, and also supports your existing SQL*Plus scripts.
